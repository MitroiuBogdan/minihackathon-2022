 * Implement the land() function as follows:
 * input: Celestial object
 * output: String, name of celestial, initial capital case, "failure" if no celestial/null is provided
 * <p>
 * Requirement:
 * you cannot use the "instanceof" construct
 * make sure there can't be another celestial besides the 3 in our solar system
