 * "There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't."
 * <p>
 * Instructions
 * You and your friends are participating in a treasure hunt and to make it interesting you
 * have come up with a secret "language" and these are the signs that can form messages:
 * 1 = go straight ahead
 * 10 = turn left
 * 100 = turn right
 * 1000 = go back
 * 10000 = confuse enemies (reverse the order of the signs)
 * Given a decimal number, convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.
 * Here's a couple of examples:
 * Given the input 3, the function would return the array ["go straight ahead", "turn left"] because 3 is 11 in binary.
 * Given the input 19, the function would return the array ["turn left", "go straight ahead"] because 19 is 10011 in binary.
 * Notice that the addition of 16 (10000 in binary) has caused the array to be reversed.
