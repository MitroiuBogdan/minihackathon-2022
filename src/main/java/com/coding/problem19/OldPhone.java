/**
 * You are a detective investigating a crime. You found an old phone (with button, not a smartphone)
 * as evidence. It's a strange phone, but the colleagues from the lab found out that it's unlocked
 * using a letters only password, and they which digits were pressed.
 * <p>
 * Write a program that returns all possible letter combinations, for a given subset of digits.
 * <p>
 * A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. <p>
 * 2=abc 3=def  <p>
 * 4=ghi  5=jkl 6=mno  <p>
 * 7=pqrs 8=tuv 9=wxyz <p>>
 * Note that 1 does not map to any letters.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: digits = "23"
 * Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: digits = ""
 * Output: []
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * Input: digits = "2"
 * Output: ["a","b","c"]
