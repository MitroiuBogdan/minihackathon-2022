/**
 * Defining:
 * A subarray of an - element array is an array composed from a contiguous block of the original array's
 * elements. For example, if array = [4,5,6], then the sub arrays are [4],[5],[6],[4,5],[5,6] and
 * [4,5,6] cold not be. [4,6] is not be a subarray as it's not a contiguous subsection of the original
 * array.
 * <p>
 * The sum of an array is the total sum of its elements.
 * An array's sum is negative if the total sum of its elements is negative.
 * An array's sum is positive if the total sum of its elements is positive.
 * Given an array of integers, find and print its number of negative sub arrays on a new line.
 * <p>
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains a single integer, 1<=n<=100 , denoting the length of array .
 * The second line contains space-separated integers describing each respective element,  -10000 <= a <= 10000 , in array .
 * <p>
 * Output Format
 * Print the number of subarrays of having negative sums.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input
 * 5
 * 1 -2 4 -5 1
 * <p>
 * Sample Output
 * 9
